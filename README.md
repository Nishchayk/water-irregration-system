# water-irregration-system
this is the code written for Arduino Uno  and it help you automatic water irrigation system
I will give overall point of my project 
moreover this project main point of view is to control waste age of water in framing fiels were we can see nowdays 
how this project works?
Anywhere in farming fiels water level goes low or goes high than the mositure level of the soil and even in the water tank 
it gives call to the farmer for 10sec and call gets disconnect and once farmer gets notified if he calles back motor turns on/off 
based on the requirement of farmer
